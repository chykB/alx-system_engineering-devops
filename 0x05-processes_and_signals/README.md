Project Description:
This project is focused on explaining the concepts of processes and signals in computing.

Key Concepts Covered:
Processes: A process is a program or a set of instructions that are currently being executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It can be thought of as a container for a program in execution, with its own memory space, system resources, and state.

Signals: Signals are software interrupts sent by the operating system or other processes to a running process, usually to request it to perform a specific action or notify it of an event. Signals can be used to terminate a process, pause its execution, or handle exceptions and errors
