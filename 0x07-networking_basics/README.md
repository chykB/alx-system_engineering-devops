Networking Basics
Networking is the practice of connecting two or more devices together in order to enable communication and data exchange between them. It is an essential part of modern computing, and is used in a wide range of applications, from personal computing to large-scale enterprise systems.

This project is aimed at introducing the basic concepts and components of computer networking. It covers topics such as network types, components, protocols, and concepts that are essential for anyone interested in learning about computer networking.

Network Types
There are several types of networks, each with its own characteristics and use cases:

LAN (Local Area Network): a network that connects devices within a small geographic area, such as an office or home.

WAN (Wide Area Network): a network that connects devices over a large geographic area, such as across cities or countries.

Internet: a global network of networks that enables communication and data exchange between devices and systems around the world.
